AI Citations and reflections:
ChatGPT is the tool used. 
AI generated code was never copy pasted into any part or section, and therefore is not citated.
AI has been used for code clarification and reasoning as well as syntax qestions,  
in the same manner as how you would use/ask a TA for help. 
All code is therefore self written and developted.
